## Small Unit Communications Mesh Extension
Utilizing an ESP32, a GT-U7 GPS, and a HMC5883 compass along with the painlessMesh library this project aims to build a small and simple mesh communications network among small unit teams. 4 GPIO buttons allow users to navigate menus and send simple messages with pre built lists in the form of Object - Distance - Order. This is meant to bridge the gap of small units unable to communicate through hand signals or radios in environments where coming off of their system is ill advised. 

### Contacts
"Inf", "Vec", "Obj", "FS", "LP/OP", "Comm", "FOB", "Friend", "Unkn"

### Distances
"<25m", "25m", "50m", "100m", "150m", "200m", "300m", "400m", "500m"

### Orders
"ENGAGE", "Observe", "Retreat", "Follow", "Mark", "Regroup", "Dig-in", "Spread out", "Hold"
